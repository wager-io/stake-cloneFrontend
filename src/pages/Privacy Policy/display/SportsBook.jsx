      <p>Matches not played as listed<br />
      In situations where the event is played at a venue different to that listed, all bets on the event will stand provided the match is not switched to the opponent’s ground and home and away team for a listed match are not reversed, in which we reserve the right to void betting.</p>

      <p>In the event of a change of opponent from the one listed, all bets for that match are void.</p>

      <p>If a team field their reserve team or an underage team instead of their first team, we reserve the right to void betting.</p>

      <p>If a match does not adhere to the generally accepted format (e.g., unusual period length, counting procedure, format of a match etc.); we reserve the right to void betting.</p>

      <p>If the rules or format of a match differ from our accepted norm, we reserve the right to void betting.</p>

      <h3>Markets including overtime</h3>
      <p>All match markets DO NOT include overtime unless otherwise stated.</p>

      <h3>Odds/Time Changes</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to change the odds-on offer at any time as well as suspend or close betting on events before the scheduled start time.</p>
      <p>In the case of any obviously incorrectly displayed or calculated prices, we reserve the right to void betting. This includes a deviation of more than 100% in the pay-out compared to the market average.</p>

      <h3>Technical Errors</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend odds during an event due to failed transmission or other technical related issues or if fraud is suspected.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to void bets even subsequently if any such bet was won by the customer because of a technical fault or error, inclusive of but not limited to an error or fault in transmission.</p>

      <h3>Abandonments, cancellations & postponements</h3>
      <p>Unless otherwise stated in the Specific Rules for the specific sport:</p>
      <p>If a match is postponed or abandoned and is completed within 48 hours of the previous scheduled start time, then all open bets will be settled with the final result.</p>
      <p>If the match is not completed within 48 hours, then all undecided bets are considered void.</p>
      <p>Please note that games which have their start date altered well in advance to accommodate live TV, or to ease fixture congestion will not be classed as postponed.</p>
      <p>An abandonment is where a match is halted before the completion of the allocated match time and not played out to conclusion on the same day. Markets which have been determined at the time of abandonment (i.e., the outcome has already been decided) such as ‘First Team to Score’, ‘First goalscorer”, etc. will stand. The market must be fully determined for bets to stand.</p>
      <p>If live coverage must be halted and the match finishes regularly, all markets will be settled according to the result.</p>

      <h3>Push Rule (2-way Markets)</h3>
      <p>In the event of a Winner market (with just home and away team as outcomes) being offered and the event results in a draw we will settle the market as void.</p>

      <h3>Total</h3>
      <p>When an exact number is quoted as the line for an over/ under market, if the result will be the quoted line, then bets will be made void.</p>

      <h3>Handicap</h3>
      <p>When an exact number is quoted as the line for an home/ away market, if the result will be the quoted line, then bets will be made void.</p>

      <h3>Race to X (incl. overtime)</h3>
      <p>If a match ends before the Xth is reached, this market is considered void.</p>

      <h3>Half/Quarter/Period Markets</h3>
      <p>Unless otherwise stated, only goals/points/corners etc. scored in the respective period will count towards settlement of the market.</p>

      <h3>Odd/Even Markets</h3>
      <p>Unless otherwise stated, total counts of zero will be settled as Even.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>If the outcome of a market cannot be verified, we reserve the right to delay the settlement until official confirmation. If the outcome of a market cannot be verified officially, we reserve the right to void them.</p>
      <p>If markets were offered when the outcome was already known, we reserve the right to void any betting.</p>
      <p>All bets will be settled per the final outcome confirmed by the tournament officials regardless if they had live coverage or not.</p>
      <p>In the case of an incorrect settlement of markets, we reserve the right to correct them anytime.</p>
      <p>Voided bets are not counted toward the customer's wagered amount or VIP progress.</p>

      <h3>Head to Head</h3>
      <p>Unless otherwise stated in the Special Rules for the specific sport:</p>
      <p>At least one competitor must finish the event, or all bets are considered void.</p>
      <p>If one or more competitor(s) fail to start all bets are considered void.</p>
      <p>If all competitors are disqualified or otherwise excluded all bets are considered void.</p>
      <p>If both competitors in a head-to-head achieve the same result and no draw odds are offered, then all bets are considered void.</p>

      <h3>Outright Markets</h3>
      <p>Outright markets are considered All In Run Or Not and therefore will be settled as a loss if the selection does not take part in the event.</p>
      <p>In cases where the event is cancelled then all bets will be declared void.</p>
      <p>In cases where the venue for an event is changed, we reserve the right to void any betting.</p>
      <p>Unless stated otherwise, whenever the organising association deems it fit to include any necessary rounds, matches, or series of matches (e.g. Play-offs, Play-outs, Postseason) following the end of the so-called Regular Season in order to determine the classification, league winners, promotion/relegation, etc., Sportradar will take into account the results and outcomes deriving from these matches for settlement purposes of tickets referring to the final league classification, promotion, relegation, etc. For example, seasonal bets on the team winning the NHL will refer to the Stanley Cup Winners.</p>
      <p>All events are settled based on the award ceremony or the competition’s official scoresheet, without taking into consideration the results of any subsequent investigations or disqualifications.</p>

      <h3>Dead Heat Rule</h3>
      <p>Dead Heat rules apply for Outright markets. A dead heat is when two or more competitors tie for a position in an event. In these cases, we will send a dead heat void factor based on the number of positions tied for divided by number of competitors tied in that position.</p>

      <h3>Cashout</h3>
      <p>Cashout is a feature that offers the customer the opportunity to take a return on a bet placed before the bet has reached its conclusion. Cashout is available on selected events and markets both Pre-Match and Live for Singles and Multi bets. Cashout is not available for Same Game Multi bets. If you choose to cashout (if available) you simply need to click on the Cashout button next to your bet in the 'My Bets' section of the site. The Cashout amount will then be credited to your account. Please note that the final result will then have no impact on the outcome of your bet.</p>

      <p>The following also applies to the Cashout feature:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cashout may not be available on certain markets and events.</li>
        <li>A time delay is applied on every Cashout.</li>
        <li>Cashout will not be available if the event and/or market you have placed a bet on is suspended.</li>
        <li>A Cashout attempt may not be successful if a market or event is suspended or odds change at the point in which the time delay is applied after Cashout is attempted.</li>
        <li>Where Cashout is available on a Pre-Match event, if the odds provider do not cover the event Live then Cashout will be unavailable once the event starts.</li>
        <li>Your Cashout value will differ depending on how your selection is performing and may be higher or lower than your original stake, allowing you to guarantee a profit or minimise a loss.</li>
        <li>Stake reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a cashout on any bet that has been settled in error.</li>
        <li>Stake will not be responsible in the event that Cashout is unavailable due to technical issues. Any bets will be settled as normal based on the final result.</li>
        <li>Stake reserves the right to remove the Cashout feature for any customer who misuses it by regularly taking advantage of Pre-Match price movements to close their bets before events have started.</li>
        <li>Stake reserves the right to remove the cashout feature for any customer who misuses it by taking advantage of latency to guarantee profit when placing bets then immediately cashing out.</li>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Soccer</h2>
      <p>
        All markets (except halftime, first half markets, overtime and penalty shoot- out) are considered for regular time only unless otherwise stated.

        <p>
          Match betting - Who will win the match? All match betting will be settled in accordance with official competition rules. In matches affected by adverse weather, bets will be settled according to the official result. If there is no official result, all bets will be void. In the case of a tie, if the official competition rules do not determine a winner then dead-heat rules will apply. In competitions where a bowl off or super over determines a winner, bets will be settled on the official result. In First Class Matches, if the official result is a tie, bets will be settled as a dead-heat between both teams. Bets on the draw will be settled as losers. If a match is abandoned due to external factors, then bets will be void unless a winner is declared based on the official competition rules. If a match is cancelled then all bets will be void if it is not restarted within 48 hours of its advertised start time.

        <p>Runs off Delivery - How many runs will be scored off the specified delivery? The result will be determined by the number of runs added to the team total, off the specified delivery.</p>
        <p>For settlement purposes, all illegal balls count as deliveries. For example, if an over starts with a wide, then the first delivery will be settled as 1 and, although there has not been a legal ball bowled, the next ball will be deemed as delivery 2 for that over.</p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">General Format Note</h2>
        <p>
          All runs, whether off the bat or not are included. For example, a wide with three extra runs taken equates to 4 runs in total off that delivery. This also includes penalty runs which occur during the delivery. For example, if the ball hits a fielder’s helmet on the outfield (5 penalty runs) while the batters run 1, this would result in 6 runs off that delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Hundred, an over will consist of 5 legal deliveries, so a full innings will be made up of 20 overs. For example, if there are no illegal deliveries, the 5th ball bowled in the innings will be displayed as “X runs off 5th delivery, 1st over” and the 6th ball bowled in the innings will be displayed as “X runs off 1st delivery, 2nd over”. If there is an illegal delivery in the first five balls bowled, the 6th ball bowled in the innings will be displayed as “X runs off 6th delivery, 1st over”. All other rules remain the same as other formats.

        <p>
          Extras and penalty runs in the particular over count towards settlement unless penalty runs cause the innings or match end before a ball is bowled in the over, in which case that over will be void. If a run out occurs in the bowler’s run up to end the game, and no deliveries have been completed in that over, bets will be void.

        <p>
          How many deliveries will the named batter face? To match the scorecard, so in this case
          wides do not count, but no-balls do. If a batter retires hurt, but returns later, the total
          deliveries faced by that batter in the innings will count. If the batter does not return later,
          the final result will be as it stood when the batter retired.
        </p>
        <p>
          In limited overs matches, bets will be void if it has not been possible to complete at least
          80% of the scheduled overs in either innings due to external factors, including bad weather,
          unless settlement has been determined, or goes on to be determined. Result will be considered

    <li>Penalty runs after the conclusion of an innings: Penalty runs added to a team’s total after the start of the other team’s innings do not count towards settlement of markets in the previous innings.</li>
    <li>Incorrectly created matches: If a match is created in the wrong format (i.e. T20 instead of List A), bets will be void and a new match will be created.</li>
    <li>Incorrect toss news: If live markets are sent with an incorrect toss result and the wrong team batting first, markets will settle as normal during and at the conclusion of that team’s innings.</li>
