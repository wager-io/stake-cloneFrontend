      <p>
        Often we find it is easier identifying problem gambling in others, but harder to recognise when this affects us as individuals.
        Although problem gambling often results in financial problems – the impact of problem gambling usually stretches much further than this.
        Recognizing the effects of gambling dependency is crucial in identifying and addressing the problem before it escalates further.
        Gambling dependency, also known as gambling addiction or gambling disorder, can have profound consequences on various aspects of an individual's life.

      <p>
        Gambling addiction can have a serious impact on relationships which can make it even harder on the gambler. Consider the following:
      </p><br />
      <ul style={{ paddingLeft: '20px' }}><br />
        <li>I’m arguing more with my partner or family – especially about money, budgeting and debt.</li>
        <li>I’m preoccupied with gambling and finding it difficult to focus on other things.</li>
        <li>I’m spending less time with my friends and more time gambling.</li>
        <li>I’m not able to tell people the truth about how much I have lost.</li>
        <li>I’m stealing money from friends and family to gamble with.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The impact of gambling on relationships is profound and multifaceted, affecting not only the individuals directly involved but also their loved ones, including children.
        Recognizing the signs of gambling addiction and seeking help early is crucial in mitigating its destructive effects on relationships.
        Counseling, therapy, support groups, and financial guidance can provide individuals and families with the tools they need to navigate the challenges posed by gambling addiction
        and rebuild their relationships on a foundation of trust, communication, and mutual support.
