      <h2>House Advantage/House Edge</h2>
      <p>Games have a house edge to ensure a percentage of the total amount wagered is returned to the House, which in this case is Stake.</p>
      <div className="br"></div>
      <h2>Randomness</h2>
      <p>All gambling has an element of randomness - there is no way to control the outcome of any casino game or sporting event.</p>
      <div className="br"></div>    
      <h2>Independent Outcomes</h2>
      <p>Games/Spins are not related. Their outcomes are not dependent on how much, or how long, youâ€™ve previously played the game for.</p>
      <div className="br"></div>
      <h2>Odds and Probability</h2>
      <p>Odds and probability are ways to describe your chances of winning. Whilst the odds can appear to be low, there are no certainties in betting.</p>
      <div className="br"></div> <br />
      <h1><strong>Introducing Our Responsible Gambling Tools</strong></h1>
      <p>Gambling should always be a form of entertainment. In order to assist you in keeping your gambling activities fun, Stake has a range of responsible gambling tools which you are able to make use of at any point in time.
      <div className="br"></div>
       Play for fun, not for funds.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Gambling Limits</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Loss limit</h3>
      <p>A loss limit allows you to set a limit on how much you can afford to lose over your set period of time. The limit can be set over a period of one day, one week or one month. It is a net loss limit. Profits made during your set period will not count towards your limit amount. If you are profitable during the set period, you are able to use your profits to continue to wager and bet until you reach your loss limit. Unsettled bets count towards the limit. Please check your unsettled bets if you are unable to place bets, as these unsettled bets may be causing you to reach your limit.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Wager limit</h3>
      <p>A wager limit (or betting limit) allows you to set a limit on how much you can wager over your set period of time. The maximum bet limit can be set over a period of one day, one week or one month. The limit is not a net limit so profits are excluded. This means, if you are profitable during the period these profits are not offset against your maximum bet limit.
      <div className="br"></div>
      Decreasing an existing limit(s) is effective immediately. When increasing your limit(s), your new limit(s) will be subject to a <strong>24-hour cool off period</strong> before your new limit takes effect.</p>
      <br />
      <div className="br"></div>
      <h2>Self-Exclusion</h2>
      <p>A self-exclusion tool offers the ability to suspend all access to your account should you feel that you are at risk of developing a gambling problem, or in some cases, believe you currently have one.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>The available periods are as follows:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>6 Months</li>
        <li>1 Year</li>
        <li>2 Years</li>
        <li>3 Years</li>
        <li>4 Years</li>
        <li>5 Years</li>
        <li>10 Years</li>
        <li>Indefinite</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>In the event an indefinite exclusion is set, access to your account(s) will remain blocked until such time should you actively request to revoke the indefinite exclusion. The indefinite exclusion imposes a minimum exclusion period of at least 6 months, from the date of application. Once the 6 month period has lapsed, your account can be considered for reactivation subject to a formal return to play review.
      <div className="br"></div>
      In order to initiate the review process, please contact our support team via email.</p>
      <br />
      <div className="br"></div>
      <h2>Break in Play</h2>
      <p>Stake also provides alternative options to suspend your account temporary, known as Break in Play. Whether you would like to take a break from gambling to re-evaluate your personal goals, save some money or simply spend time on other activities, the option is made available to you.</p>
      <br />
      <p>The available periods are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Day</li>
        <li>1 Week</li>
        <li>1 Month</li>
        <li>2 Months</li>
        <li>3 Months</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Stake reserves the right to self-exclude a customers account should we determine that gambling may not be safe for you to continue.</p>
      <br />
      <h2>Applying a Self-Exclusion on your Account</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to our Stake Smart Self-Exclusion <strong>page</strong></li>
        <li>Select the <strong>'Request Self-Exclusion'</strong> option in the bottom right hand corner</li>
        <li>Using the drop down options, select the applicable timeframe</li>
        <li> Once you have selected the timeframe, proceed by clicking <strong>'Next'</strong></li>
        <li>Confirm your self-exclusion by proceeding with clicking on the <strong>'Confirm'</strong> option</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p>Note:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It will not be possible to reactivate your account until the chosen time period has lapsed</li>
        <li>Where a defined self-exclusion is in effect, your account will automatically reactivate once the chosen time period has lapsed</li>
        <li>Where an indefinite self-exclusion is in effect, whether applied by the client or operator, a minimum of 6 months must pass before the account can be considered for review</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <div className="br"></div>
      <h2>Closing My Stake Account</h2>
      <p>Stake provides the option to close your account should you wish. An individual may opt to close their account for different reasons, perhaps does not find gambling entertaining anymore, or for any other personal reasons unrelated to problem gambling.</p>
      <br />
      <p>To close your account, a request must be made to our Customer Support Team via chat or email which is support@stake.com</p>
      <br />
      <p>It is important to note that once your account has been closed, Stake will prohibit you from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accessing your account</li>
        <li>Receiving any further bonuses or promotional material</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <div className="br"></div>
      <h2>Reactivating Your Closed Account</h2>
      <p>In the event you wish to reactivate your account, a formal written request needs to be made via chat or email service (support@stake.com) for the account to be reactivated. A minimum cool off period of 24 hours must lapse from the time the account was closed, before your account may be considered for reopening. In some instances, Stake may, at our discretion, conduct internal checks prior to making a decision to reopen an account.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Note: Stake reserves the right to close a customers account at any point in time, at our sole discretion.</p>
